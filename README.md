#  🎬 IMDb Movies Data Analysis & Excel Dashboard  

## 📌 Project Overview
IMDb is one of the most popular online platforms for movies and TV shows.

## 🔑 Key Insights
*  Highest Rated Movie: The Shawshank Redemption.

*  Lowest Voted Movie: To Be or Not to Be.

*  Most Common Certificate: R dominates movie counts.

*  Votes vs Ratings: Movies with the highest ratings don’t always receive the most votes, indicating quality doesn’t always equal popularity.

## 💡 Recommendations
